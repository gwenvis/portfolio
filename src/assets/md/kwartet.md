# Quartet

Quartets is a commercial card game similar to Go Fish. The game was invented in the Netherlands where it is known as kwartet.[1] (wikipedia)  
I made this because I wanted to learn more about networking, and the assignment given by school was the perfect excuse to.

## What I did

### Sockets

For the connection, I had the choice between several different options: Either a node js server, or connecting devices to each other using sockets. I settled on the sockets mechanic, as I didn't want to host the node.js server, and so anyone could play it whenever they wanted in that case. One downside is, though, that they all need to be connected to the same network. However, that is one of the few downsides.

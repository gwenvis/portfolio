# Talepsin Virtual Human

From February until July I had an internship at the startup [Talespin](https://talespin.company), this is a company that very recently rebranded from Sticky Studios.

At Talespin I worked on their Virtual Human technology, which was meant for training purposes. At this internship I developed my programming skills a lot and also got a good sight on how professionals program.

Working at Talespin was a very fun experience and everyone was very helpful. They treated you a lot like an employee and they let you work on things that would actually be used by the ones playing the games. 
Talespin's codebase is very nice to work with, and I will certainly apply the concepts they had in my future projects.

Because of an NDA I cannot go into full detail of what I have done nor show it all.

## Dialogue Editor

Most of my time at Talespin has gone into working with the Dialogue Editor.

Talespin has an internal dialogue editor, which is based on Twine. In the dialogue editor I worked on the intent editor. The intent editor is an editor that allows the dialogue writer to enter "utterances" and "intents", which then will be used by the Natural Language Understanding service.  

For the intent editor, I also made it possible for 2 different versions to be merged. When utterances or intents collide with each other, the merger can choose which utterance belongs to what intent, and then publish that version.

I also worked on new macros, which will execute when a passage has been activated, and my latest addition to the dialogue editor is a way of exporting a story and all it's variations to a `CSV` and `XLSX` format.

## Scoring

I partly had a hand in the scoring system that was made for our first project, where I also implemented the result screen.

## Other

Naturally that's not all that I have done, but those are the biggest tasks I have finished and that are being used right now. The rest are smaller, and of which I can't go into full detail of.

As this was my first internship at a software company, I didn't really know what to expect from it. I got really used to working though, and it was less stressful than I thought it would be. Because of this experience, I'm really looking forward to finishing school and starting work at a development company.

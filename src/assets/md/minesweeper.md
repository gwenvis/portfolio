# Minesweeper

In the third year of school, we had to create small test-assignments where we just create small programs/games that recruiters often use to challenge you and to see if your code is up to par for them. The first assignment was a minesweeper, where the main feature was supposed to be the flood fill.

The UI resembles a Windows 98 desktop and it also uses the 98 minesweeper sprites. As extra fun I made a feature where you can move around the window and even close it. (With no way to open it again...) 

## What did I do and learn?

### Webpack

Having barely used node or npm, I decided to use typescript and webpack to bundle my scripts and site. In hindsight this project would probably be easier to develop if I didn't use Webpack, but it was a good learning experience on how to use it, and I'll try and learn more about it in future projects. It did make using different classes in multiple files much easier and I appreciate that.

### Typescript

This was the first time I used Typescript, and as I really like statically typed programming language, this was no exception. Sometimes it was quite troublesome to work around it and I had to cast some objects to others, but it in the end is no problem and makes the code easier to read than with Javascript itself. 

### Flood-fill algorithm

I've known about the flood-fill algorithm before, but I've never used it in practice. It's actually just as simple as I thought and just as cool.

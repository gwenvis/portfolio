##Antonio Bottelier

Hello, my name is Antonio Bottelier, 20 years old. I am a student at the Mediacollege Amsterdam
and am following the game development course there. I'm in the third grade.
        
Ever since a child, I liked working ceatively, and is something I still do. Stuff like designing, drawing, or writing story interests me greatly.
    
I'd like to become a programmer, be it either a game programmer or anything else related. I really like thinking about how I could solve a specific problem. Programming is something I am very passionate about.

What I'm most interested in at the moment are machine learning, artificial intelligence, and networking. I'm also really interested in developing for VR, but as a result of size problems, I can not start doing it.

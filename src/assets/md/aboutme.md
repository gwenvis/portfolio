#Antonio Bottelier

Hello, my name is Antonio Bottelier, 19 years old. I am a student at the Mediacollege Amsterdam
and am following the game development course there. I'm in the second grade.
        
I've always been doing creative stuff, either playing an instrument or shooting and editing videos. And I've always wanted to make my own games, but had no 
idea how. I started looking it up, and found to that you had to program a whole lot. My 12 year old 
brain couldn't keep up and so I gave up. Then, when I turned 14 I decided to take up on the whole
programming thing again. I first started learning Python, and then I went ahead with other languages
like C# and C++. 

Right now I am working on improving my skills continuously, and programming has become something I really enjoy doing.  
I am most proficient in C#, and am constantly improving upon my skills of Javascript, C++, and I wish to learn more languages later on. 

I am interested in subjects like machine learning, artificial intelligence, networking and shaders.  
As for games, I am most interested in VR. But because this is something I do not own, and for the fact that my room is too small, I can't do anything with it.

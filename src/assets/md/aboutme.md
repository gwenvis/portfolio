##Antonio Bottelier

Hello, my name is Antonio Bottelier, 20 years old. I am a student at the Mediacollege Amsterdam
and am following the game development course there. I'm in the third grade.
        
#### History

Something I've always enjoyed is doing creative stuff. As a child, I used to film videos and edit them, and I've also played several instruments. As gaming was a hobby of mine, I always wanted to create them. I don't really remember what I started with, but what really got me into making games was Flash. I learned both Actionscript 2 and Actionscript 3 and with my limited knowledge I made small, bad, games and posted them on Kongregate. This is what started my programming love.

Instead of enjoying making games, I really enjoyed programming instead. Out of curiosity, I started looking up what else you could do with it. Looking up discussions on how to learn programming, I started with Python. Mostly creating text adventures, I hit an eventual block where I didn't understand what I was had to do. 

Then, in 2014, I found out about Unity and C#. I ended up loving C#, and it was a blast to learn C#. I quickly started looking up other languages as well, I learned Javascript, dabbled with C++, and learned how to make websites. 

#### Now

Just like 4 years ago, I am still learning something everytime I program. When I start a new project, I try to search a new framework, or a new programming concept to learn. Like this portfolio, which is the first time I have worked with Angular, is to learn something new. This portfolio is also available on [Github](https://github.com/stepperman/portfolio/tree/angular), by the way.

Currently, I am most interested in learning more about machine learning and networking.  
As for games, I'm really interested in developing for VR, but this is something I can not use, as my house is too small.

# Sapling & Flint

Sapling & Flint is a 3D Action/Adventure game made in 4 weeks, together 4 artists and 3 developers.  
In this game you fight your evil brother, and the bears he made evil, to save him and the world.

## What I did and learned

Most of the project I was working on the collision. This took up most of my time, 
as this was a challenge I did not expect this difficult.

### Player collision...

I really _tried_ making player collision work in this game, and after many methods and many sleepless 
nights I just never could figure it out. I had it working decently at some part, but then one thing
didn't work as I wanted it, so I changed it up again. In the "final" build of the game it forces the 
player on the ground at **all** times, unless going up. It sucks, and it's not something
I'm proud of. But I learned it, so it's here. Sigh.

### Boss fight?

I'm just grasping at straws here because I want more content in this, but I also made the boss fight! 
This used two (2!) state machines, provided by Timo Heijne (Epic), the main state machine, which checks
for distance, attacking phases, and dizzy states, handles well... the main states. The secondary 
state machine handles all... secondary states, as the name implies. These are the attack states, handled
by the main state machine. These are the attacks the boss can execute while in this phase. Which are only
3 attacks, but they're there.

### Being an epic voice producer

Now this was the most fun I had. I helped write the story of the game, and although not fully 
realized in the game because of time constraints and other issues, 
we did a whole bunch of audio recording for it as well.

I was the producer in all this, my microphone was used, and my laptop, for recording the voices.  
I cut all the voices up in Adobe Audition and tried to remove all artifacts that happened during the 
recording, as it was quite noisy. The audio quality was also upped for voices, and it sounds pretty neat. 
I really wish you could hear it, but you can't. Ever.

###### Sound effects

..Eh. I did the sound effects.
